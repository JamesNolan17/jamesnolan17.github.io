温柔的夜，是属于女人的。而那狂热的昼，是属于男人的。  
*The gentle night belongs to women, while the feverish day belongs to men.*

夜的柔情，在于她的静。  
*The tenderness of night lies in her stillness.*

她以最舒缓的方式，慢慢地，慢慢地进入世界，宣告梦的开始。  
*In the softest way, she enters the world slowly, slowly, announcing the beginning of dreams.*

她不像昼出现时，有红日升起的雄伟和灿烂。  
*She does not arrive with the grandeur and brilliance of the rising red sun as day does.*

她以一种令人震撼的静美和昼交替。  
*Instead, she takes turns with day in a kind of stunning, silent beauty.*

昼代替夜时，总是按耐不住着急的性子，想让太阳一下子从地平线上蹦出，给大地万物以最明亮的照耀才好；  
*When day replaces night, he can never suppress his impatience, wanting the sun to leap from the horizon all at once and shine its brightest light on all things.*

而夜这位害羞的女子，躲在昼的后面。  
*But night, this shy lady, hides behind day.*

等到昼展示完了雄姿略感疲惫时，她款款凌波来了。  
*When day has finished displaying his splendor and feels a little tired, she glides in with graceful steps.*

给昼以赞美，表示自己为他所倾倒。  
*She offers praise to day, showing how utterly she is enchanted by him.*

昼便满足了，略带留恋地一点点地踱出了世界。  
*Satisfied at last, day withdraws from the world bit by bit, with a touch of reluctance.*

于是，夜，来了——夜是昼的新娘。  
*And so, night arrives—night is day’s new bride.*

---

如果没有夜的协调，长昼会带来破坏。  
*Without night’s balancing presence, an overlong day would bring destruction.*

就像过分热情引发的狂躁和不安。  
*It is like how excessive passion leads to restlessness and agitation.*

热情的表达是耗费力气的。  
*To express passion is to expend energy.*

夜不嫉妒昼的威风，相反，她用她自己的力量去保护他，让他不至于伤到了自己或精疲力尽。  
*Night does not envy day’s grandeur; on the contrary, she uses her own power to shield him, so that he does not harm himself or burn out completely.*

夜的出现，给世上生灵带来休憩和安谧。  
*With night’s arrival, all living beings in the world are given rest and tranquility.*

包括昼，他大概也在夜的柔情中睡了吧！  
*Day as well, most likely, sleeps within night’s gentle embrace!*

---

这就像人类世界的男人和女人，男人有能力，有雄心；  
*This is like men and women in the human world: men have capability and ambition;*

而女人则是蕴含着神奇力量的宁静之源。  
*While women are a wellspring of quiet, almost magical power.*

她们懂得怎么做能让自己的爱人感到舒服、感到自己受到了心上人的崇拜，从而肯于考虑女人以及其他别人的的建议。  
*They know how to make their beloved feel at ease, feel admired and cherished, so that he is willing to listen to a woman’s advice and to others’ counsel.*

转而把自己的力量尽量多的用于创造，而不是破坏。  
*In this way, he turns more of his strength toward creation rather than destruction.*

因为，创造能让爱人开心。  
*Because creating brings joy to the one he loves.*

人们都认为是男人主宰着这个世界，可热爱创造与保护正是女人的性格。  
*People say it is men who rule the world, yet a love of creating and protecting is deeply woven into women’s nature.*

可以说男人拥有力量，女人影响力量。  
*One could say that men possess power, while women shape how that power is used.*

所谓历史，所谓文化，中间不也夹着无数男男女女爱情的结晶？  
*What we call history, what we call culture—are they not filled with countless crystallizations of love between men and women?*

文明源于创造，而很多创造源于对事、对人的强烈热爱。  
*Civilization springs from creation, and much creation is born from a fierce love for things and for people.*

---

女人是具有极强的年龄角色性。  
*A woman’s role is strongly colored by her age.*

女性成长的各个阶段，也像夜的擦黑、夜半、深更和黎明，各有各的韵味。  
*The stages of a woman’s growth resemble dusk, midnight, the deep of night, and dawn—each with its own distinct charm.*

---

少女时期，她不知用一颦一笑敲开过多少男孩的心心扉；  
*In girlhood, she has no idea how many boys’ hearts she has opened with a single frown or smile.*

此时虽无丰厚的底蕴，但已开始呈现温柔细腻多情的性格；  
*At that time she may lack deep experience, yet she already shows gentleness, sensitivity, and emotional richness.*

在青年时期，她成了淑女。  
*In young adulthood, she becomes a refined lady.*

她用对世界细腻的观察，为自己的性格和智慧奠基。  
*Through her delicate observation of the world, she lays the foundation for her character and wisdom.*

外在的静，恰当的掩盖了内心的波澜。  
*Her outward calm suitably veils the surging waves within.*

后来，她们成了妻子。  
*Later, they become wives.*

细致的照拂，贤淑的举止，平安喜乐的性格，使丈夫体会温暖，变得有担当。  
*Their attentive care, graceful conduct, and peaceful, joyful temperament warm their husbands’ hearts and help them grow more responsible.*

他和她一起，来进行人生的第二次成长。  
*Together, he and she embark on a second chapter of growth in life.*

---

再后来，她们成了母亲，女性保护的特征完全发挥了出来。  
*Later still, they become mothers, and the protective nature of women is fully brought into play.*

用好奇心和极大的喜悦接就生命。  
*With curiosity and immense joy, they welcome new life.*

她们无师自通地开始了长年的抚育。  
*Without being taught, they begin the long years of nurturing.*

父亲能用自己有力的双臂把孩子举起，而母亲则愿蹲下来听孩子的心声，并给他一个吻。  
*A father can lift his child high with strong arms, while a mother is willing to crouch down, listen to the child’s heart, and place a kiss on their cheek.*

随着长大，孩子需要更多精神上的沟通和引领。  
*As the child grows, they need more spiritual communication and guidance.*

这像号角，促使母亲开始自身第三次成长。  
*This sounds like a trumpet call, urging the mother into her third stage of growth.*

她们去学习，去改善。  
*She studies, she improves.*

外自知识、沟通技巧，内至性格、品行。  
*Outwardly in knowledge and communication skills, inwardly in temperament and character.*

“要给孩子做一个行为上的榜样”这心念，使她更温和更坚定，就像漆黑深邃的夜，夜里孕育着黎明的希冀。  
*The thought, “I must be a role model in my actions for my child,” makes her gentler yet more resolute, like the deep, ink-black night in which the hope of dawn is being nurtured.*

---

黑暗也是有温度、有味道的。  
*Darkness, too, has its warmth and its own flavor.*

温柔的夜，带给人的是陪伴、成长与坚强。  
*The gentle night offers us companionship, growth, and strength.*

于是，那夜，深了。  
*And so, that night deepened.*
